### 👋 Hi, I'm Sumit Deshar!
Hi there! 👋 I'm an aspiring software developer with a strong interest in Backend Development and Machine Learning. I'm currently honing my skills in backend systems using Python, where I enjoy building clean, scalable APIs and working with databases to bring applications to life.

I'm also exploring the exciting world of Machine Learning — learning how to turn data into insights and smart solutions. On the frontend side, I have working knowledge of React.js and Flutter, which helps me understand how different parts of an application connect and function together.

I'm comfortable with tools like Git, Docker, and Postman, and I'm always looking to improve my workflow and understanding of real-world development practices.

As someone starting out, I'm eager to learn, contribute, and grow into a developer who writes code that solves real problems — both on the backend and with data.

Let’s build something great together! 🚀
